## Video Walkthrough

Here is a reminder on how to embed Loom videos on GitHub. Feel free to remove this reminder once you upload your README. 


## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- Favorite applications
    - What's app
        - Background color will follow the system color
        - Good layout easy to use
    - Bilibili
        - Easy browsing layout
        - Good color combination for both daytime layout and dark mode
        - Open screen ad. This is good for the App operation, but not a good thing for user.

- App idea to build
    - Instagram
        Currently I feel instagram that contains too many ad, that I feel I cannot really spend time seeing my friends moment. Need to rebalance the protion of ad and friends' post. Also, I feel when I use ins, it is not easy to change another tab with one hand, need to redesign the funciton action.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
